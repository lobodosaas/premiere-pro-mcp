const facts = [
  {
    question: "What is MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro?",
    answer: `MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro is a free, MIT-licensed, open-source Model Context Protocol server. It connects compatible AI clients to structured Premiere inspection, editing, automation, and export tools through a local bridge.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What does MCP mean?",
    answer:
      "MCP means Model Context Protocol, an open standard for connecting AI applications to external data, tools, and workflows. This project is an MCP server built specifically for Adobe Premiere Pro.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Premiere Pro MCP the same product as MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ‘MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro’ is the preferred product name; ‘Premiere Pro MCP’ is a common shorthand; and `premiere-pro-mcp` is the npm package name. They identify this independent open-source project, not Adobe’s native AI Assistant.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Premiere Pro versions are targeted?",
    answer: `Released packages target Premiere Pro ${product.premiereCompatibility} on Windows and macOS through the default CEP compatibility path. UXP features require a compatible Premiere ${product.uxpMinimumVersion}+ host and advertised capabilities. A version range does not prove that every operation will work on every machine.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Does it upload Premiere projects or footage?",
    answer:
      "The recommended setup keeps Premiere, the bridge, the MCP server, and project media on the same computer. The selected AI client's own data handling and privacy settings still apply, so the project cannot make a universal no-upload claim for every client configuration.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is it different from Adobe Premiere AI Assistant?",
    answer:
      "Adobe Premiere AI Assistant is Adobe's native in-app public beta for supported organization, preparation, and initial-assembly workflows. MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro is an independent open-source integration for compatible MCP clients, local structured tools, and explicit capability and verification boundaries. The two can be complementary; evaluate the exact current workflow and privacy behavior rather than assuming either route is universally better.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it an autonomous video editor?",
    answer:
      "No. It is designed for reviewable workflow automation. Editors should inspect available capabilities, preview meaningful changes, confirm the intended target, and verify returned state or diagnostics instead of assuming that an attempted command succeeded.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many tools does it expose?",
    answer: `Published v${product.version} registers ${product.coreToolCount} core tools; the default capability profile exposes ${product.defaultProfileToolCount}. An authenticated compatible UXP host can add capability-gated tools for a ${product.connectedUxpToolCount}-tool connected surface. The development source separately registers ${sourceCatalog.coreTools} core tools, with ${sourceCatalog.defaultProfileWithUxpTools} in the connected surface; it may include unreleased work. These are catalog counts, not proof that every operation succeeds in a particular live host.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is the safest first check?",
    answer: `After installing the server and Premiere connector, ask the AI client: “${safeFirstPrompt}” This checks the connection without requesting a project change.`,
  },
