    question: "What is MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro?",
    answer:
      "MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro is an open-source Model Context Protocol server that gives compatible AI clients a structured set of tools for editing timelines, applying effects, managing media, and exporting from Adobe Premiere Pro.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Premiere Pro versions and operating systems are supported?",
    answer:
      `The signed CEP connector is the default route for Adobe Premiere Pro ${product.premiereCompatibility} on macOS and Windows, including Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. The UXP bridge adds capability-gated workflows on compatible Premiere ${product.uxpMinimumVersion}+ hosts; it is not the default installer.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Does MCP for Adobe Premiere Pro upload my footage?",
    answer:
      "The recommended setup is local-first. Premiere Pro, the connector, and the MCP server run on your machine, and the bridge exchanges commands and structured results rather than automatically uploading project media. Your AI assistant’s separate privacy settings still apply.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which AI clients can connect to it?",
    answer:
      "Claude Desktop has a released self-contained bundle and is the recommended starting point. Codex has an installable plugin in this repository. Cursor, VS Code / Copilot, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients can use the local server route. The Premiere connector is installed separately; a native one-click installer for every client is not currently shipped.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the MCP server remotely?",
    answer:
      "A remote HTTP transport is available, but it requires authentication and a working connection back to the local Premiere Pro bridge. For most editors, the local setup is simpler and safer.",
  },
