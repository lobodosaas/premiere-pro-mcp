# Cinematic homepage experiment

The current visual refinement is documented in [Apple-inspired homepage refinement](apple-homepage.md). It supersedes the split-hero composition below while preserving the experiment contract. The original direction and palette verification are retained here as design history.

The user's brief is a complete 3D, animated homepage with a PostHog A/B test. The implementation direction is a cinematic editing studio: near-black indigo canvas, titanium surfaces, Premiere violet actions, film frames suspended in depth, and precise timeline typography. The existing homepage remains the control. No product application or documentation routes are redesigned.

## Visual target

At 1440px, use a 1280px content width, a 76px navigation rail, and a split hero. Left: a short release label, “Your vision. In the timeline.”, product explanation, and two actions. Right: original cinematic artwork behind a floating command panel and a three-dimensional timeline. The artwork and timeline must be the dominant visual, with real readable HTML controls outside the WebGL scene. A compact facts rail closes the first composition.

Continue with an interactive three-chapter workflow, an illustrated video walkthrough, a local connection diagram, a client-specific installer, accessible FAQs, and a large final action. Vary composition instead of repeating a card grid. Keep all current setup, recovery, compatibility, privacy, source, and documentation destinations discoverable.

## System

- Premiere palette, refined September 10, 2026 at the user's request: accent #9999ff and accent text #00005b match [Adobe's official Premiere icon](https://main--cc--adobecom.aem.live/cc-shared/assets/img/product-icons/svg/premiere-pro.svg). Supporting indigo neutrals: canvas #080811; surfaces #111120 and #1b1b32; text #f4f3ff; secondary #afafc7; line #30304b. Semantic CSS tokens also scope the portaled mobile menu. The WebGL scene and original artwork use the same violet direction.
- Geist Sans for editorial type; Geist Mono for timeline/timecode and labels. Hero 52–88px, section titles 36–56px, body 16–18px. Small labels at least 11px.
- Four/eight-pixel spacing rhythm, 8px control radius, 16px major viewport radius. Subtle borders; depth reserved for the film stage.
- Motion: spring pointer parallax on fine pointers, slow timeline drift, short scroll reveals. Global pause control. Reduced motion and save-data use still compositions. Suspend rendering when hidden or offscreen. No scroll hijacking or custom cursor.
- Use Radix tabs, accordion, and dialog; Lucide icons. No fabricated product screenshots, customer proof, or live-host claims.
- 320/360/390/430px: stack hero, reduce scene height, wrap action row and fact rail, use horizontally scrollable client tabs. 768/1024px: two columns when readable. 1440px: full composition.

## Experiment contract

- Flag: `homepage-cinematic-2026`; variants `control` and `test`, intended equal split.
- Assignment belongs to an anonymous signed visitor cookie and PostHog's flag evaluator. Server chooses the complete HTML before rendering; no client layout swap.
- Primary outcome: actual setup-download clicks (`homepage_setup_downloaded`); secondary: successful safe-prompt copies (`homepage_safe_prompt_copied`). These are onboarding intent, not verified installation or activation.
- Expose once the assigned root document is visible at first paint, not after React or WebGL. Direct preview routes, preview query parameters, bots, DNT/GPC, disabled configuration, and unavailable flag decisions do not emit exposures. Server assignment emits `homepage_experiment_assigned` as a diagnostic only; it is not `$experiment_exposure`.
- Keep GA's existing bounded onboarding events. Send only allowlisted actions and variants to PostHog, using visitor identity rather than the MCP server's operational identity.
- Control fallback on configuration/network failure; do not enable the experiment until the deployed variant and the correct PostHog project are verified.

## Verification

Production build and existing byte budgets; server assignment/exposure/privacy/tamper tests; desktop and 320–1440px browser captures; keyboard navigation, installer tabs/copy/error states, dialog close/focus restoration, FAQ, motion pause/reduced motion, console inspection, and accessibility scan. Test the root route through the actual HTTP server, including nonce CSP, rather than treating the standalone preview as root-route evidence.

September 10, 2026 palette verification: landing lint and production build passed, including the existing JavaScript/HTML byte budgets. All 34 existing Playwright end-to-end tests passed against the actual local HTTP server and local PostHog fixture. SEO export validation passed for 27 canonical pages and 926 links/anchors. Visually checked the full desktop page, animated scene, 390px hero, and portaled mobile menu in the local preview; no browser errors were reported. This palette revision was verified locally; these checks do not constitute a production deployment.
